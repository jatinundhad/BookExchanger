            Welcome to our book exchange website! We are a community-driven platform
            where individuals can exchange books with one another, free of charge. Our
            mission is to promote literacy and a love of reading by making it easy for
            people to access a wide variety of books.

        <h2>How it Works</h2>

        <p>
            Users can sign up for an account and create a profile. Once logged in,
            they can search for and request books from other users. When a request is
            accepted, the two users can arrange to exchange the book(s) in person or
            through mail.
